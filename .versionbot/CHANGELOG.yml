- commits:
    - body: |-
        A concurrency of 2 creates too many competing pull requests in most
        repos. product-os/jellyfish needs at least 2, so will override in its
        renovate config.

    - subject: Reduce concurrency from 3 to 2
- commits:
    - body: |-
        Reduce concurrency as one of our two package rule groups is not
        used very often and we instead end up having two mergeable PRs
        fighting with one another. This results in one of them merging and the
        other having to be rebased and trying again.
